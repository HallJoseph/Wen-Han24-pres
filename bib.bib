	abstract = {Based on the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys released data and available spectroscopic redshifts, we identify 1.58 million clusters of galaxies by searching for the overdensity of the stellar mass distribution of galaxies within redshift slices around preselected massive galaxies, with 877,806 clusters being found for the first time. The identified clusters have an equivalent mass of M 500 ≥ 0.47 × 1014 M ⊙ with an uncertainty of 0.2 dex. The redshift distribution of clusters extends to z ∼ 1.5, and 338,841 clusters have spectroscopic redshifts. Our cluster sample includes most of the rich optical clusters in previous catalogs, more than 95\% of the massive Sunyaev–Zeldovich clusters, and 90\% of the ROSAT and eROSITA X-ray clusters. From the light distributions of the member galaxies, we derive the dynamical state parameters for 27,685 rich clusters and find no significant evolution of the dynamical state with redshift. We find that the stellar mass of the brightest cluster galaxies grows by a factor of 2 since z = 1.},

	abstract = {Accurately determining the mass of galaxy clusters is fundamental for many studies of cosmology and galaxy evolution. We collect and rescale the cluster masses of 1191 clusters of 0.05 z 0.75 estimated by X-ray or Sunyaev-Zeldovich measurements and use them to calibrate the optical mass proxy. The total r-band luminosity (in units of \{L\}*) of these clusters is obtained by using spectroscopic and photometric data of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that the correlation between the cluster mass \{M\}500 and total r-band luminosity \{L\}500 significantly evolves with redshift. After correcting for the evolution, we define a new cluster richness \{R\}L*,500=\{L\}500 E\{(z)\}1.40 as the optical mass proxy. By using this newly defined richness and the recently released SDSS DR12 spectroscopic data, we update the WHL12 cluster catalog and identify 25,419 new rich clusters at high redshift. In the SDSS spectroscopic survey region, about 89\% of galaxy clusters have spectroscopic redshifts. The mass can be estimated with a scatter of 0.17 dex for the clusters in the updated catalog.},

We cross-match these clusters with those in the catalogues identified from the X-ray surveys and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect by the Planck, South Pole Telescope and Atacama Cosmology Telescope surveys, and get the redshifts for 45 X-ray clusters and 56 SZ clusters. More than 95 per cent SZ clusters in the sky region have counterparts in our catalogue. We find multiple optical clusters in the line of sight towards about 15 per cent of SZ clusters.},

	abstract = {We first present a catalogue of photometric redshifts for 14.68 million galaxies derived from the 7-band photometric data of Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer using the nearest-neighbour algorithm. The redshift uncertainty is about 0.024 for galaxies of z ≤ 0.7, and steadily increases with redshift to about 0.11 at z ∼ 2. From such a large data set, we identify 21 661 clusters of galaxies, among which 5537 clusters have redshifts z {\textgreater} 1 and 642 clusters have z {\textgreater} 1.5, significantly enlarging the high redshift sample of galaxy clusters. Cluster richness and mass are estimated, and these clusters have an equivalent mass of M500 ≥ 0.7 × 1014 M⊙. We find that the stellar mass of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in each richness bin does not significantly evolve with redshift. The fraction of star-forming BCGs increases with redshift, but does not depend on cluster mass.},
